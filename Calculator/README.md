# Note: CLI Calculator Instructions



I am currently working on developing a professional calculator; however, at this stage, I have implemented a basic calculator that operates in the command-line interface (CLI).


## How to Run the CLI Calculator:

**1. Download or Clone:**
 - Download the file or clone the repository to your computer.

**2. Install Dependencies:**

 - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
 - **Run the command:** **'npm install'** to install the necessary dependencies.

**3. Compile TypeScript:**

 - **Run:** **'tsc'** to compile the TypeScript files.
 
**4. Run the Calculator:**

- **Execute:** **'node index.js'** to start the calculator.


## Functionality: 

- **Basic Operations:** The calculator supports addition **(+)**, subtraction **(-)**, multiplication **(*)**, and division **(/)**.

- **Error Handling:** If you provide only one input, the calculator will return an error and prompt you to enter more than two values. It will then ask you to input the values again.

- **Input Options:** You can choose the number of values you want to use in the calculation.

- **User Interface:** The results are displayed using **chalk** for better readability.

- **Re-run Option:** At the end of each operation, you will be prompted to perform another calculation.



## Future Plans:

I am currently occupied with other tasks, but I plan to enhance the calculator to include scientific functions in the near future. For now, it only supports basic arithmetic operations.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
